[![hub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Yifeeeeei/Monkey)

This is where I keep my Tampered Monkey user scripts. Might comes in handy:

- [![hub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Exam_Arrangement_Filter-gray)](https://yifeeeeei.github.io/Monkey/exam_arrangement_filter.user.js) can help you find your exam schedule on Tsinghua info by adding a seach button. I have no idea why that page looks a century old and does not have that in the first place. (Last checked Sep. 2023)
- [![hub](https://img.shields.io/badge/WLXT_Theme_Tool-gray)](https://yifeeeeei.github.io/Monkey/wlxt_theme_tool.user.js) can help you customize your Tsinghua online studying platform. Yes, it's 2023 and they don't have a dark mode. So this is a script that can help you create your own color scheme.
- [![hub](https://img.shields.io/badge/YuKeTang_Theme_Tool-gray)](https://yifeeeeei.github.io/Monkey/yuketang_themetool.user.js) Another color scheme script that customizes YuKeTang. But it also added some cool features like everyday rainbow farting.
- [![hub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bilibili_Search_Shortcut-gray)](https://yifeeeeei.github.io/Monkey/bilibiliSearchHotKey.user.js) I like using "/" for accessing search on Github, this script add that for Bilibili. It also enables left and right arrow for choosing and enter for selecting.
- ... and probably something else

## WzryAmongUS üïµÔ∏è
