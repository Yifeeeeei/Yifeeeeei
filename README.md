# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yifei Chen. Currently a Master student in Computer Science at UC San Diego.

# Education

## Tsinghua University (Sep 2019 â€” Jul 2023)

**Bachelor of Engineering**

Major: Software Engineering

## University of California, San Diego (Sep 2023 â€” Expected May 2025)

**Master of Science**

Major: Computer Science

# Internship Experience

## Xiaomi Inc. (Jul 2022 â€” Aug 2022)

**Mobile Algorithm R&D Dep.**

Successfully built up a quantization framework to reduce the computation power by 75% needed by a neural network, thus making a computer-run model operable on mobile devices, then further improved its User Interface to broaden its user base.

# Reasearches

## Computer Stereo Vision: Point Cloud Enhancement Based on Data Fusion

Python, PyTorch, LiDAR

Bachelor thesis project on stereo vision. Designed and implemented a deep learning algorithm that makes scene LiDAR point cloud denser and more uniformly distributed by using information gained from monocular images. Increasing the uniformity by nearly 100% comparing to other point cloud upsampling algorithms.

## Wearable Device: Ultrasound Earphone Sensing for Whispered Speech Gestures

Python, PyTorch

A collaborative research project between Toronto U., Tokyo U., and Tsinghua U.. I drew the research protocol,
set up the analysis pipeline and trained the machine learning model, the recognition rate is 70%.

# Projects

## Hitch Ride Android App for University Students

Java, Android Studio, Firebase, Google Cloud Platform

Course project for the Introduction to Mobile Application Development course. We wrote an Android app called By The Way that allowed student to find others for a hitch ride around the campus. Frontend written with Android Studio, backend implemented with Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.

## Context-Based Multimodal HCI Project

Python, TensorFlow, Keras

Built up a Recurrent Neural Network that distinguishes emotion within speaking, implemented onto a smart robot that won us the 3rd prize of the 32nd Tsinghua Student Laboratory Contribution Award among a cohort of 147.

## Big Data Processing and Analysis (FloK) Platform of Tsinghua

Python, PyTorch, JavaScript, HTML

Programmed a â€™drag and drop neuron network model building systemâ€™.

## Pattern Recognition and Transfer Learning Coursework

Python, PyTorch

Increased the recognition accuracies of 3 assigned Convolutional Neural Network models by as much as 11%
through redesigning and programming in the transfer learning, and generalization processes.
